**Empowering Health Through Seamless Remote Monitoring**

Main Components:
1. **ESP-WROOM-32** (Microcontroller)
2. **MAX30100** (SpO2 & BPM sensor)

This project work on the main principles of **IoT** and sending acquired data over cloud. It can remotely  measure the patient's **BPM**(heart rate) & **SpO2** (blood oxigen saturation rate) . The "**MAX30100**" sensor used  to measure body parameters of the patient, centrally connected to "**ESP32-WROOM-32**" , which collect the  data and sends the same over the cloud & display the respective outputs on "**Blynk**" Application. The data is  transferred using **TCP/IP** communication securely.
